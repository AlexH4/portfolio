          <p>To be an effective programmer requires certain qualities and characteristics. Although it may seem like I have a long way to go in order to become a programmer, I have never lost interest in becoming one. Ever since I was young I was inspired by the many computer games developed by famous websites. These things fueled my desire to learn by taking classes or self learning online. I plan to become a programmer by progressing slowly, but effectively so I can understand completely with ease.</p>
          <p>My name is Alex H. I am currently a junior in Dublin High School. I have little bit of programming experience as I used the programming languages LUA and BASIC for a short amount of time. In world languages, I took Mandarin for 3 years and continued learning Japanese for 5 years.</p>
          <p> I would consider myself to be a quiet yet a flexible person. I have learned from my work experience that I prefer working independently although I do not mind working in groups. Other than that I sometimes tend to work in duos. My belief is that if you try something only then it gives you a chance to succeed. Thank you for reading this page and I hope for you to find the rest of this site interesting.</p>
